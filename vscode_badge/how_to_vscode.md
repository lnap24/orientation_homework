1. Text editor v word processor v IDE
2. Visual Studio v VS Code
3. Shells, what is a GUI vs a CLI
4. Bash (Bourne Again Shell), syntax, environmental variables like PATH
5. package management, conda, conda environments
6. I cloned this repository from GitHub, configured the default terminal to be bash, and now I am committing this change back up to github.
7. pwd i think means path to working directory, so if I want to know where my file is in my computer i type it and it tells me
8. ls seems to give me a list, the Table of Contents, of my repository. It doesn't tell me what's in folders, but it tells me the first level of my repo
9. cd is for changing directory, I type cd and then the name of the directory I want to be working in
